1,I trusted my instincts.,"I always chose the lesser of two evils if all the revealed nodes were negative, if they showed positive i chose the highest, then i trusted my instincts on the rest. I am generally a naturally good guesser.",the node to the left.,when i had no more turns.,"sometimes when i clicked all three nodes, only two numbers were revealed, if they were both negative then i took my chance on the one that wasn't revealed. ",35,no.,"The game itself was exciting, but i don't really like to gamble because i hate losing money so it was a little stressful every time my numbers would get up to 160 then drop back down to 20. This is why i don't go to the casino, losing money is not fun for me. i don't understand the appeal of gambling."
2,Where there were high losses,Where there were green numbers and not red,at the branches closest to me. ,when I found a way to get something positive,I would not click further in one direction if a high loss was closest to me.,45,No. It was a fun game,Thank you.
3,Anywhere that started out as -10 I wouldn't click beyond. ,I decided I'd try the first circle of each path until I got a positive number.,The closest circle to the starting point of each path.,When I had enough information to know I would be in the positive.,Nothing else I can think of. ,30,No,
4,the negative numbers,where the spider would go first,the first spots,when i found positive numbers,,52,no,
5,,,,,,28,,
6,"if the amounts were negative to begin with, I didn't click further. ","I started with the first node out, and if that was green I checked the attached nodes. ",in any of the first nodes away from the spider. ,when I found a path that seemed to have the most money possible. ,I just tried to click as few spaces as possible to find my way. ,41,No. It was all pretty clear. ,This was really fun. 
7,random,random,to the left,random,"not really, just random.",38,no,
8,I usually did not want to waste clicks next to the start if I found a 10 at the end. I also did not waste a click if the end value was a -10 since that direction would be too risky to take.,"I tried to select one node from the ends of each web to see if any would be positive and, if so, if they were 10 (felt safer going there) or if they were 5 (could be a negative before the end that would wipe out the 5).",At the end value of the upper right web,"Often I would use up all my clicks but sometimes I would see a 10 at the end, maybe click the second to last node and, if it was also positive I would just take that route with no further clicking.","I tried to use my clicks to explore the greatest area, so I would choose an end value from each of the three trails. If that end value was 10, I figured that I would likely not get two other negative tens on that path, so I would select to go ahead. If the value was a -10 I would avoid that path since I could also be facing a -5 along the way and even with a 10 I would still be losing. If the value was a -5 I might click another node on that path to see if it was 10 so that I could hope to at least break even on the path.",49,"No, the directions were clear and the practice trials were very helpful.",Thank you -- this was fun and challenging!
9,I didn't really.,I went different directions from the last time,Left,When I was out of space,,29,,
10,in the beginning I was going in the direction opposite of a first negative number but that didn't really work,randomly for a while and then I tried the same path a few times in a row ,up,no real method,no,48,no,none
11,"When the last node was negative, I didn't go that way.",I usually tried to find the nodes with the $10.00 value at the end.,At the paths' last node.,I usually stopped when I found the $10.00 at the end.,"Once I found a $10.00 node at the end, I just stopped clicking and hopped for the best.",35,No.  The instructions were clear and the game was a lot of fun.,I had fun!  Keep them coming!!!
12,The obsolete buttons that had little to no bearing in branch decisions.,I strategized by clicking the balls that mattered the most and connected to most branch options.,The branch node that had three branches.,When I found the maximum possible output.,no,41,no,fun survey thanks!
13,Based on doing it before and it not turning out right,I tried to remember patterns before that paid a decent amount of money.,"I just used the arrows to go right, never clicked.",I never clicked because I didn't want to loose money,"Just tried to remember from practice what was best.
",33,I did better during the practice than the other rounds.,"I didn't see anywhere how long this would take, and it took much longer than expected for pay since it was determined by bonus."
14,If I saw -10,If I found a green I'd follow that path until I see 3 green or if it was good enough to go down.,If I saw a green.,If I ran into a -10 or a -5 in the first 3 clicks.,Nope.,27,Nope,Thanks!
15,I tried to avoid directions in which I would lose money.,I tried to discover most nodes and then went with what gave me more money.,In the blocks directly to the sides.,When I was losing more money than I could possibly make in that round.,No.,22,Nothing was hard or confusing.,
16,If I got two reds in a row I'd stop that path,I started with the closer ones to me and followed the path if it was green,On the left bubble closest to me,If the reds added to more than I can make in the path then I would stop that path and start another,I was looking for large green numbers to start and following that path first.,39,No it was not confusing at all,Thank you so much for this study
17,By clicking the nodes closest to me first and gauging their values.,Yes,The nodes closest to the spider.,When an amount looked attractive.,No.,21, No.,
18,It was just by instinct ,Just went with my gut in an area where I was doing well in the beginning but that changed later in the game.,Right is my favorite direction and it seemed to be working for a while.,I felt like I would lose too much money by clicking,No if I had a better strategy I would have made more money. I was doing well in the beginning but that did not continue.,63,No,
19,Same as above.,I used the node inspector ,To the right.,I just did.,No,30,No,No
20,Clicking anywhere but the end was a waste of money,Always click the end of any stem. Stop clicks when 10 is found.,top left of left quadrant,10 was the greatest value so it was pursued whenever found,"It is simple, don't waste clicks, guess for a 10, pursue 10",23,No,None
21,i avoided -10s,"after using the information tool, i just went down the best route",to the right,when i saw an advantageous route,not really,36,no ,
22,random choices,random choices,to the left,got to the end,no,31,no,no
23,once there was a very large subtraction of funds.,I just went for the first one in each direction,The first node to the left,When I saw a good final outcome,no,42,No,none
24,At first I didn't really have a method but clicking the end of the paths was smarter than what I was doing at first.,I wanted to try to start on a node with the highest possible amount and I checked the end of the paths as well.,The first 3 possible directions. ,If I got at least 1-2 10's I felt there was no point to keep looking.,Not really. I actually feel like it could end up being worth it to check all of them.,24,No it was really fun,
25,If I lost money on two consecutive clicks I tried another path.,I worked out from the center to try and decide which way I should try first.,A the beginning of the path that paid the best on the previous round.,When it looked like there was no upside to be had.,My strategy stayed the same but there seemed to be fewer chances to win money as the game progressed.,66,No,That was a fun game!
26,I tried to not waste too many clicks.,I tried to click on just a few.,Random,Tried to click as few as possible,No,51,No,No
27,Try to avoid the negatives.,Tried to look for the best option.,The end of the routes.,Go to the end of the route.,Try to find the most money.,48,No.,This study was interesting.
28,"Once I found a $10 node, I quit.","I just tried to click on the first node to move to and if it was $10, I would quick clicking and move in that direction.",One of the first nodes at random.,After finding a $10 node,Not really.  Just guessing.,60,no pretty simple,
29,If it was a negative number on the first node,I checked all of the first nodes if it was a ten I checked that path farther,right side path,when I had a profitable path found,I kept my strategy simple. ,29,No the instructions were perfect. ,No comments 
30,Not going the same way too much.,I tried not to go in the same area too many times,The top arrow.,I just stopped when I could not move anymore in hopes of maximizing my earnings.,I was just trying to take random paths.,32,No,
31,"If it was a good enough deal, I did not click any more",Mostly random choices.,The right most path,"When I was happy with my choice of path, I stopped clicking",Just kind of guessing and hoping it would be a decent deal. ,27,"Easy to understand, fun to play.","Thank you for this HIT, it is interactive and great pay. Appreciate it."
32,I stop when I see that its -5.,"Well, I clicked the first three nodes.",the first three nodes.,"Depends but generally, if the first node is already negative, I will stop.","I can't explain it.... But I maximize everything. If already got three green nodes, I pursue it right away.",23,None.,None.
33,If an end showed a big negative number i wouldn't click around that path.,I clicked on the last node of a path and went with the highest path.,I would mostly click the bottom right one. From the practice rounds it was almost positive every so rounds.,Once i felt comfortable with a path. It didn't subtract that much from my pool.,I wouldn't try to click and reveal more than 4-5 nodes. Try and get at least 10 out of each round.,36,No. Easy to understand.,Really loved the game.
34,"Never clicked the middle nodes, and never clicked stuff that was in a path where the first node was negative.",I clicked first nodes out until I found a positive. Then I would click on one of the furthest out points of the positive path to see if it was negative or positive.,Any of the first nodes.,"Once I had found a positive first node, and knew whether it was a positive or negative to left or right at the fork.","It was pretty much what I said when saying how I decided how to click, but only other thing was the last click was either a positive or negative. If it was positive, that was path I went, if it was negative I went the other path.",34,Nope.,
35,Same as above,I tried to rely on intuition but it failed me,I did't really have a method,When I was losing more money than I was winning,No real method,28,no,
36,I took a gamble each time i tried to play,wild guess,to my left,When I reached the end of the line,no strategy,42,no,
37,It was random guessing,It was random guessing,Top,When I was losing too much money,I had no strategy,21,No,No
38,did no go to -10,checked around to find first 10 ,left,when i found 2 green on one side,no,39,no,none
39,I GUESS AT TI.,I GUESS AT IT. ,I DON'T KNOW,I DO KNOW.,NO.,58,NO. THIS WAS NOT RIGHT.,NO. IT WRONG.
40,I decided not to click when I decided that the chosen route was more advantageous.,"I decided the joint nodes and immediate nodes to scan, though I should have chosen the joint nodes from the start.",I clicked exclusively at the beginning of the round and towards the middle. I took more risk near the end of the round.,I tried to stop clicking after 3 or 4 clicks.,That's about it other than hoping for the best.,33,"At first, I forgot that I could click on any node before moving the spider and it didn't have to be on adjacent nodes.",It was fun.
41,I didnt click,I didnt click,I didnt click,I didnt click,I went to where the positive points were in the previous,19,no,Was pretty fun
42,"I didn't, it was entirely random.",I was trying to remember patterns.,No order.,When I got to the end.,Nothing.,27,No.,
43,I tried to stay away from the -10,I thought using the same line would give pretty reliable results but i decided to click the center of each 3 lines to try and find the highest positive number,right,It depended on if I was above 10,I just tried to stay in the positive in each round,31,no,
44,I only clicked the outer most points.,The outer most points.,Outer most points on any side.,When I found a ten.,"That is it, find a ten and go towards it.",35,not at all,
45,some didn't need to be because it was a bad route anyway,random,then end circle,once a good path was found,once a good path was found just went with it,26,no,no other comments
46,if the second to last was a high loss,the second to last was a good indicator of how much i would make,always the second to last node,max was 3 clicks for me,chase the 10's,40,no,n
47,I did not want to follow a trail of negatives.,I tried to look for a pattern. I then had to evaluate totals vs options,It varied but mostly to the left.,I usually stopped for a total of 20 to 25.,I could only hope for the best.,52,no,
48,I really just based this on a guess.,"I took a chance on where to click, if I clicked a node in the previous round, I clicked a different node in the next round to get a variety.",I think I mostly clicked on the first node up or the node just to the right.,I only clicked on one node per round and ventured a guess at the nodes based on that one node.,"I kind of based my movements off of the first practice rounds, such as where I saw the most positive amounts of money.",44,"No, nothing was confusing or hard to understand.",This was a lot of fun to play
49,I did not click on areas that I did not think would reveal significant information for me to make a decision about which route to take.,"I clicked on nodes that were most likely to reveal characteristics about the whole path, like whether it was mostly a gaining money or losing money path, such as the starting point or end point of the node.",I was most likely to click on the nodes immediately surrounding the center node so I could see if I would lose or gain money by making my first moves.,I decided to stop clicking when I identified a safe path to maximize the money I collected without losing much money. ,,20,No.,
50,based on already clicked nodes.,based on corners.,one of the 3 adjacent nodes to the center.,when i got a safe route.,that's about it.,25,no,
51,if there was already a path with enough information that would be greater or equal to maximum possible path with nodes remaining hidden,tried to find a path with most possible money taking into account maximum that could be under each path with nodes still remaining hidden,three nodes surrounding center spider,"preferred to have most information, but tried to click as much as possible without losing money on the round, although I was willing to have some negative rounds to get best info",like to have more info even if it costs a little,62,no,
52,There was no need to click the furthest away nodes first if I didn't know how much I would lose before getting there. ,I tried to find the highest paying node closest to the spider so I could click on the fewest.,the nodes closest to the spiders,"Once I had 2 out of 3 good choices, or once I hit five clicks. ","I clicked the node closest, then the furthest once I found a high paying close node.",49,not confusing,
53,I did not click the nodes that were down the spider web that were negative numbers.,I clicked the nodes down the spider web that had a positive number.,I chose the closest nodes from the spider first.,when the total appeared to be positive.,if the total was for the first nodes was 10 I would guess on the last node without seeing what it was.,23,Everything was clear.,Interesting Experiment
54,"If there was a negative high number to start, I gave up on the ones after it.","I went with the highest reward I could find, and if it looked profitable, I chose those.",The first 3 inner closest nodes.,"I had a certain amount in my head, after I reached that amount I went with the most profitable option, without having to peak at others too much.","2 out of 3 was pretty good, so I guessed and hope to get lucky a lot. I didn't do all 3 closet nodes all the time ",33,,Cool Hit! Thanks
55,i avoided the red numbers,i followed the green numbers,the first spot to my right left or front,when i could see a path that looked good enough,just try to end up on the positive side,33,no,:)
56,When nodes were red,By inspecting nodes and seeing which ones were green,Wherever there was a green node,If too many red nodes were in that path,I clicked on green nodes and took a chance based on that,32,no,thanks
57,I chose to avoid the directions that I thought would cost me money,I just chose the directions I thought would provide me with the highest payoff.,To the left.,When I lost too much money.,I just tried to look for patterns.  It did not work out for me.,33,"No, I thought everything was clear",
58,Last ones,Second guess was always first.,The second move,When I was in the green,If I got a 10 I would see what the route was,30,No,Fun game
59,check end point,Took path with initial positive amount by paying for information,circle on the left,Tried to kept investment down to 3 clicks,no,50,no,no
