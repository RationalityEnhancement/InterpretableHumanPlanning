58,I never got into the habit of clicking the second node the spider encounters.  I originally thought the first node was more important in figuring out what path was better but I realized the amounts in the end nodes had more of a bearing on how much I earned.,I originally thought that picking a node next to the spider would help me narrow down my choices but I changed that strategy once I earned more money.  At that point I started to focus on the end point nodes instead.,"Initially, I focused on the right or left nodes directly next to the spider but eventually, I focused on the outer nodes where the rewards were greatest.
