0,If it was a negative amount that I could avoid,Used inspector when possible to direct me where to click.,To the right or left of the spider,Based on the previous result,"If the first circle had the highest amount, I would take that direction",44,no,
1,"I was kind of confused through half the game so I'm not so sure I knew where to ""not click"" until the games was more than half over","It wasn't easy. After I understood the game somewhat, I looked at how much I had to lose once I crossed the minus in red numbers.",up above or down below,Somewhat guess work.,"No, I did terrible. I wish I knew what I was doing. ",63,Oh yes. But then maybe it was me. ,"I'm guessing since I'm older I'm also slower at understanding things.
I don't know really."
2,I just guessed,"I just randomly picked a direction. However, if I went one direction and it went well, I sometimes decided to click that way again.",To the right,I just went all the way to the end of the line,"I just made guesses honestly, I did not have much strategy.",27,No,
3,if i had to go to that node anyway,based on the location of the bug,near the beginning,when i maximized my potential,no,22,no,no
4,I felt it wasn't worth the $1 to click on the inner most circles,I clicked the last set of circles to find where a green 48 was,"any of the outermost circles, except for where the green 48 had been in the previous round",when i found a green 48,"it was pretty simple, i just wanted a green 48, and felt the green 48 from the previous round would most likely not be in the same spot twice in a row",42,not at all,none
5,If it was a bad decision on the first node then I didn't need to test anymore in that set,I chose the highest value nodes,in the first nodes,when I got the highest amount or a good guess,,29,no,
6,,,,,,,,
7,Just guessed randomly,Just guessed,To the left,When I thought I found the largest number,"No, it was pretty random",49,No,I enjoyed this task
8,I didn't click much on the outer nodes.,"It was sort of random guessing on the first three nodes. I didn't really see much of a pattern, but if I revealed a 48 first, I moved that way and did not click any more nodes.","One of the closet nodes, usually the left first.",When I felt like I had already got the maximum numbers.,I felt like if I found the 48 right away that I should go in the direction because the loss after that wouldn't outweigh the 48.,37,No,This was fun!
9,never on the first node,Only end nodes,the end nodes.,Once I found a +48,"Once i found a 48 at an end node, I normally just went to it.",25,Nothing. Straight forward.,No.
10,Where ever the largest - number was on the first move,Where ever the large + number was on the first move,the first 3 spots,"After the first click only, just because :)","No strategy, just luck. ",49,No,That was fun!!!!
11,I didn't click ifI already knew where I was moving,i checked all the closest ones because they make the most difference.,right,When clicking any more wouldn't make a difference,,32,no,
12,The lowest number,i used the $1 to look ,the frist circles,after 3,that's it. ,27,no,cheers
13,Because 8-4=12 is less to lose than 24 or 48 so I clicked on the nodes to see the highest values to see if I can follow the path with the highest value outcome.,First node had the highest value so I chose the three nodes closest to the spider.,The left node closest to the spider.,When I found a 48 because no matter what that would be the best path.,It was worth it to find the 48 value node in order to end up with the highest value at the end. ,27,"No, the game was easy to understand.",I liked this.
14,If the node that I clicked was a negative number I chose between the other two nodes,I thought about my previous click and how it turned out,on the node to the right,I always went through all three nodes,,39,No,
15,I did not click the low value ones,I clicked only the biggest ones which were the -48 to 48 because those could cause the most damage or gains.,first level,After I got 48,No,25,No,
16,I did not click on the closest nodes because they had low sums of money.,I always chose the last nodes because they had the highest amounts of money.,The upper left end node.,I stopped clicking when I found an end node with $48.,I always went towards the highest priced end node.,21,No,
17,It appeared less successful going up instead of going left.,I didn't click. I used the arrow keys. I wasn't entirely sure how the game was supposed to work but it appeared more successful turning left than going up.,To the left.,When I ran out of moves.,Confusion and mystery.,31,,It's kind of like gambling.
18,Hardly if ever checking the first tile because it was a waste.,Check the last tile until I find 48. Then the second tile. If it's an 8 then 48+8 is an automatic move. If an eight shows up in a direction I haven't revealed the third tile then I'll check those and go for the highest score on the board. If positive 48 isn't available then go for the next highest value with the same rules applying.,Start at the top left last tile and go clockwise until I find 48 in one of the tiles. Then check the second tile. If it was an 8 automatic pass if not check the others and if there was a positive 8 elsewhere then check the outer tiles there too.,When I found 48 in the outside followed by a 4 or 8 in the second tile.,Minimize the information I needed to buy while maximizing the effectiveness of the information I get was pretty much the gameplan. If the outer tiles cost more then I may have been more hesitant about how I bought information but since the most valuable info was priced the same it was really easy.,24,No.,Thank you for the game. It was fun!
19,Whichever had the lowest starting value.,Whichever had the highest starting value.,The first 3 starting nodes,When I found a +48,"Nah, pretty basic.",28,Nothing hard or confusing.,No comments.
20,the last nodes did not seem worth the dollar it would cause to click since the value was so low.,The first spot would determine where I should go ,the first nodes,if the first node had a really good price point I would stop there.,it;s mainly chance,29,no,none
21,"I only clicked on the end value since it was the highest, and I stopped when I got to 48",I clicked until I saw an end value of 48.,I didn't have a set strategy for what was the first circle to click.,Once I had discovered a 48,"To only worry about the end of the path, and not the values between the beginning and the end.",27,No,It was fun!
22,anything outside the first step wasnt worth the click to me,i clicked the first step til i found a postive one or if all negative i ended up clicking on all 3,same throughout,after i found what first step i was taking,that is about all of it,39,no,
23,Negative number,Random,Right of center,positive 48,Initial click in each round different direction than previous round IF I ended up with positive amount in previous round... FUN guessing game!,65,No,That was fun....I wanted to 'win'  : )
24,probability,probability,right,it was at random,N/A,23,NO,N/A
25,"After I looked at my first few, if it was a negative value I wanted to avoid that.  ","I usually wanted to spend the $1 to see the first nodes so I would know what direction to go.  After that, I just clicked where I felt I should in the moment.",The node to the left of my starting place.,"If I got a positive value, I decided to go ahead and stop clicking most of the time.",Not really- it was kind of spontaneous.,33,Nope,
26,if that path did bnot matter,first node first,first nodes,when it was the obvious best path,not really... seemed kida obvious,51,not really,nothing comes to mind
27,"If I already had found a ""48"" I stopped clicking","It was random, but I almost always clicked for the first node.",The left or right node,"If I found a ""48"" if I didn't, I kept clicking. ","Only spend money for the first nodes because it will be worth it to find the least expensive negative, or the most positive value",23,"No, it was fun!",*comments (this question is spelled wrong) 
28,wherever the amount was lowest,wherever the amount was highest,on the last step spots,when I found 48,no,34,no,none
29,"I decided, if it was negative, and the other first option was positive","I decided by looking for the biggest first number, then if then there were 2 I looked at the second, or if not I looked at the third",the right first option,If another had a bigger opening path,I went with my gut,29,no,none
30,I just checked the first nodes mostly.,I payed to see the tiles.,Top center node,When I knew the best direction,Just guessed after I had a direction,36,Nope,Thank you for the game!
31,what the previous inspector showed,inspector,left,just based on how i felt ,no ,25,no,
32,I avoided red,I clicked to find the 48 and went for there,The corner nodes,Once i hit 48,It seemed effective.,33,no,Fun experiment. 
33,"Once the biggest gain or least loss path was found, I stopped clicking. ","Clear the first points with the node scanner, and pick the path of least resistance. ","The first 3 nodes, any order.",Once the biggest gain or least loss path was found.,"Minimize losses, maximize gains, that's it really. ",24,No,Excellent HIT. 
34,I wasn't concerned with losing up to 8 dollars,I just wanted to know what the big payoff would be,left top ,Once I found the 48 dollars,I just looked for the 48 points,39,no,fun study!
35,I didn't want to click on nodes that made me lose money,I used the node inspector to decide my first move since it was wo,the node worth the most,after the first node when i knew which path was initially worth the most,,24,no,
36,"If a node had -24 or -48, I would know that heading in that direction will cause an overall negative amount.",I checked either of the boxes right next to the spider in three different directions to see how much I could still make even if the second or third nodes were going to be negative values.,Right next to the spider.,I did not want to spend over $2 on each round to keep the expense low of the reward I had already won.,"In the practice rounds, I never saw an amount over 24 in the 2nd or 3rd presses of the up,down,right left keys. So I knew the 1st click I made had to be right next to the spider at the beginning of each round.",25,None,Cool game
37,"Well if it shows me already the best possible option or near best possible, its obvious to just not waste the dollars clicking onto the others that are most likely going to be worse options anyways.","I went with the most logical, figure out your beginning steps of the path to determine if the others were to be good choices.",The first three bubbles to see which bubble would be the highest paying or least depleting option.,"When I figured out which path was the securest, whether it be the one that accumulated the most money or if it was the one that made me lose the least, if loss was an inevitable result.",Intuition played a great deal in it honestly. Just had to feel it along with thinking.,22,"Well sometimes the bubbles wouldn't actually change when I clicked them, so I was beginning to think this was done on purpose so to make it that we had to go off of chance, but after a bit I was thinking its actually a technical error with the coding. Doesnt pick up clicks directly ontop of the bubbles, sometimes must click around them for it to work. But by the time I figured this out I was halfway done.",Thank you all for all of your hard work!
38,if it was looking like all negative,Random choice,the right side,When i found the combo,No real strategy,33,No,None
39,Whatever path had the lowest first node count,"Clicked the first node in each direction, unless the first one was a plus 48. Then I started on that path","Any first node until I found the highest count, or the first 48","If the first node was plus 48, then went on that path","I started out clicking the first nodes in all directions hoping to find a plus 48, then I'd click the second node, then the last two to get the highest score. Then I decided that just clicking down the first 48 path might save some money.",68,No,Thank you! The hit was FUN!
40,"never the first, payoff wasnt worth ir",Last node because it was worth the most,Any of the end nodes,when I saw a green 48,N/a,21,No,Fun hit
41,"Typically, I didn't click the end nodes, or past any negatives, unless all the options were negative.","I clicked on the first node to determine initial gains. If one first node was identical to another, I would click to see if the second node had positive value","first nodes, closest to starting node, most often the node on the left side","If I had two positive numbers in the first and second nodes, especially if the first node was 48, I stopped. If I got a 48 in the first node, I typically followed it without more exploration.","I decided the cost of clicking too much would negate most gains gotten by discovering the most lucrative path before starting. I tried not to use the exact same paths over every time. I felt like I was on the clock, so ""cost of time"" was a factor, even though I knew the exercise wasn't timed. ",30,No,You should name the spider. I suggest Harry.
42,I randomly decided where not to click,i randomly decided where to click,up,when I could not go any farther,I think that there is no strategy and that it is luck of the draw,30,no,
43,I did not choose the inner nodes,I chose the outer nodes.,Where the 48 was not in the previous round.,"When I found the 48, or in some cases, the 24 (which was the highest in the that particular round)",That's all. Fun study!,60,No.,All good.
44,I based it off chance and guessing,I knew that the larger numbers were on the outside corners so I just check those instead of the inside nodes because they were less.,the outside points. ,after clicking at least two outside points. ,none.,32,no,fun game
45,I generally didn't click on the inner nodes because the values were too small to care about.,"I clicked only the outer nodes until I revealed a +$48. In the few situations where only a +$24 was available, I clicked on the middle nodes as well (+8 to -8) to find a more positive route.",On the outer node that gave me $48 in the previous round.,I stopped clicking when I found an exterior node that gave me $48.,"No, I think I summed it up pretty well above.",33,"No, the tutorial made it very clear.","You misspelled ""comments"" directly above this box"
46,strategy was to stick to the same ones,i just picked one and decided to stick with that one then another,the middle,when i felt satisfied with what i was getting,"stick to the same spot for the first click, then go from there",32,"no, the trials covered it",no
47,"I tried to avoid the paths that didn't end in 48, even if there were some good positive values in between. ","I tried to choose the path that ended with a 48 and avoided the others, even if the path to 48 had some negative values in between. The 48 had so much value it overcame any negative ones. When I had to pay to click, I figured out that it would be best to click on the end ones until I found the 48 and then click the path to that, not worrying about what was in between. ",At first I clicked all the way through each path until I found the 48. But over time I realized I was just wasting dollars by clicking through all those and all that mattered to was finding the 48. ,"I stopped when I found the 48 node, because that's the path I was going to choose. ",I went for the 48 because it ended up with more in net gain because there weren't high enough negatives in between to overcome it. ,44,No. ,None
48,It seem that the positive 48 would appear on the bottom corners and less likely to appear at the top left and right nodes. I avoided clicking the top nodes unless I had to.,It was random at times or I clicked the same circle I clicked previously. I clicked until I saw a positive 48 and then I stopped clicking.,The bottom left and right corner nodes.,As soon as a positive 48 appeared I would stop or if the only options were positive 24 then I would stop clicking.,"My strategy was random but If in one round I clicked on a positive 48 on my first try, I would click that same node in the next round.",30,Everything was perfectly clear.,
49,by intuition as well,by intuition only,the right side choices,intuition too,it's just pure luck,29,none,
50,"I started at the end points, kind of randomly",I looked for the end at $48,"The left side, outermost layer.","I would stop either at $48 and go there or, if there were two $24, I'd go in a layer to see which was more money.","Not really, but it seemed to work well.",36,nope,nope
51,randomly,randomly,to the right ,when I got to the end,,25,no,
52,Anywhere where I considered the loss too great.,By checking the values.,The largest and closest nodes.,When I figured out where I would make the most.,That's about it.,28,No.,No.
53,Where it was unlikely a higher number was.,Based on what had already been clicked.,The corners at the end,When I had enough information,I used as many hints needed to find the highest numbers,36,Everything was clear,Thank you for the opportunity to participate!
54,If I found a good number early I would click somewhere else next time.,"I chose randomly, but tended to start at the top and work clockwise.",I always clicked at the beginning.,"When I revealed a positive 48, I would stop.","My strategy was to find the highest number early, and then move toward it.",37,No,
55,"if the end point was not a real option, did not pursue that branch further",Started with the ends to rule out the negatives,Any end point,When I had what I thought would almost be the most favorable outcome,T-branches were only clicked to avoid large 2nd-stage negatives,31,"No,very straightforward",Fun HIT!
56,Avoided the negative final nodes.,Paid to see the final node and where the $48 was.,The final nodes at the end.,When I hit the $48,"Find the $48, go get it.",41,No,
57,NEGATIVE VALUES ,BASED ON VALUE (POSITIVE),TO THE RIGHT OF STARTING POSITION,WHEN I FOUND THE VALUE I WANTED ,NO - THAT'S IT ,28,NO,NO
58,The lower values.,The highest payoff or highest negative values.,The top.,When I find the highest payoff.,None really just finding the highgest payoff.,32,Nope,None
59,The first and second nodes don't really matter,"the most I could lose before reaching the final point is $12 so if I even fine one location worth $24, it would be a positive gain so I clicked on the last nodes.",just at the end nodes,I just stopped at an arbitrary 4 clicks.,No,22,No,
60,decided not to click the ones immediately next to me as they were the lowest amount to worry about.,tried to find the $48 on the first set of clicks.,top left.,If I found the 48 I tried to stop so I would not waste more money.,"if  I found more than one higher amount in two different directions I would click the one before it to see which one was most likely to lose money, and then went to the one that looked more likely to not lose.",45,It was easy to understand.,nothing additional to add other than thank you for the study.
61,middle,ends,ends,once i found 48,,20,no,
62,I avoided the most negative value.,I picked the most positive value.,To the right of center.,When I reached the maximum positive value.,It seemed the higher values were on the top.,55,No.,Fun! Thank you.
63,I never clicked on a node that was only one or two moves away from the center.,I looked only at the nodes 3 moves away from the center. I clicked until I saw a +48 at one of those nodes.,The node two steps left and one step up from the center.,I stopped clicking as soon as I saw a node containing +48,My strategy was straight forward and done with the understanding that the gains from a +48 would offset the costs of searching for it.,23,No,This was a very fun and interesting task. Thanks for using MTurk.
64,I did not click on the blocks near the spider because I figured the amount (plus or minus) would be much less than the ends,I decided to click on the ends because those were the ultimate goal (to decide whether to earn or lose money on the round),Random ends - but less likely to click on the same spot where I found the +48,I stopped when I found +48,If I found 2 ends where there  are +24 I clicked on another step or two to decide where I can get the most score,24,No,Thanks. It was a fun experiment. 
65,If it is negative,I always choose the path to 48,the last steps,if i already found 48 ,"when I find the 48, I decide if I still want to open one more path to get to 48",42,None,
66,I guessed.,A feeling.,The corners.,When I saw negative numbers.,No.,32,No.,I wished I earned a bigger bonus.
67,Once I got a positive I went that way,Tried to just look at the first circle until I found a positive and then follow a path,one of the first circles,Once I found a positive,I started realizing this was severely underpaid by about round 15 and only have 200 points and stopped clicking and just tried pathways with no clicking to complete the experiment. ,33,No,This is severely underpaid for the time it takes and the likelihood of winning a large bonus seemed highly unlikely. I had many all negative pathways.
68,"I decided not to click on any of the 2 middle layers as it would not be cost efficient.  In order to for the middle layers to be beneficial, I would have to reveal all the outside rows looking for duplicate +48, and then it might be beneficial to find an alternate route. However, in the bonus rounds, two +48 was rare. I feel like it would cost more then I would likely make in the long run.","In order to save money on revealing the best possible path, I simply clicked on the farthest circles in attempt to reveal a +48","I would click on any of the outer-most circles hoping to reveal a 48. After thinking about it,  I might have favored the middle-left of the screen.",As soon as I located one +48,"The strategy was quite simple, reveal outer circles until I found a 48, and proceed down that path blind (without revealing those 2 circles).  I figured it would cost more to reveal the whole board then I would save in the long run.  ",31,Nope!,It was actually kinda fun!
